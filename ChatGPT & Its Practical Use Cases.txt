We also refer to pre-training, which is the initial phase of training, a language model like GPT, where it learns general language understanding from vast amounts of text data. This phase allows the model to grasp grammar, syntax, and even some factual knowledge before fine-tuning for specific tasks.

Fine-tuning is the second stage of training where the language model is adapted to perform specific tasks. During this phase, the model is trained on a smaller task-specific dataset, helping it to generate more accurate and relevant responses in its target domain. There are also tokens, prompts, and responses.

A token is a unit of text, such as a word or character used by language models for processing and generating text. Tokens are the building blocks that models like GPT use to understand and create human-readable text based on input prompts.

A prompt is the text input provided to a language model to initiate a response. By giving the model a starting point, the prompt guides the model to generate relevant and contextually appropriate output, whether it's answering a question or continuing a sentence.

A response is the output generated by a language model in reaction to a given prompt. Depending on the model's training and the provided prompt, the response can range from a single word to several paragraphs of text that maintain context and coherence. And finally, you may hear a lot about bias in relation to ChatGPT.

Bias refers to unwanted or unfair inclinations in a model's output, often resulting from biases present in the training data. These biases can lead to unfair or offensive responses, and it's essential to be aware of them when working with AI models like ChatGPT.
