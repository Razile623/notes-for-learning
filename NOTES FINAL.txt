		//Use the substring method to locate the first name
		firstName = custName.substring(0, spaceIndex);
		System.out.println(firstname);
	}

Consist of a set of webpages;
	list all the classes in the API
		description of what the class does
		list of constructors, methods, and fields for the class
	Highly hyperlinked to show the interconnections between classes and to facilitate lookup


StringBuilder Class

-mutable alternative to string
-instantiated using the new keyword
-has many method for manipulating a value

StringBuilder mySB = new StringBuilder ("Hello");
mySB.append(" World");

public class Shoppingcart{

	public static void main(String[] args){
		String firstName;
		String	custName = "Sally Smith";
		int spaceIndex;
		StringBuilder sb;
		
		//Get the  index of the space character " "
		spaceIndex = custName.indexOf(" ");

		//Use the substring method to locate the first name
		firstName = custName.substring(0, spaceIndex);
		System.out.println(firstName);
		//Instantiate and initialize sb to firstName
		sb = new StringBuilder(firstName);
		System.out.println(sb);

		sb.append(" Smith");
		System.out.println(sb);
	}
}


Primitive Data Types
Integral types - byte, short, int, and long
Floating point type -float and double
Textual Type -char
Logical type - boolean
Unicode - primitive type

final - constant and cannot be changed

The remaining numeric operators
remainder = modulus %
	ex. 31/6
	    - mod is 1

preincrement =++variable
postincrement =variable++
predecrement =--variable
postdecrement =variable--



Promoting and Casting Variable

Promotions
	Automatic promotion

Type Casting
When to cast:
	If you assign a larger type to a smaller type
	If you assign a floating point type to an integral type

Beware of the possibility of lost precision

All literal floating point values are viewed as double

L notifies the compiler that a number is double value
F notifies the compiler that a number is float value



public class Shoppingcart{

	public static void main(String[] args){
	
		int int1;
		long long1 = 99000000000L;
		float fit1 = 13.5F;
		char ch1 = '0';
		
		//print the long variable
		System.out.println("long: " + long1);
		//Assign the long to the int and print the int variable
		int1 =(int)long1;
		System.out.println("Long assign to int variable " + int1);	
	}
}


Method and Conditionals
void method - nothing to return
main method = calling method
diplay method = worker method
constructor method - is a special method that is invoked when you create an object instance
	it is called by using the new keyword
	its purpose is to instantiate an object of the class and store the reference in the reference variable
	it has unique method signature

Method arguments and return values
arguments - is a value that is passed during a method call
parameter- is a variable defined in the method declaration

use the keyword return within a method




Static method and variables
static modifier is applied to a method or variable
method/variable:
	belongs to the class and is shared by all object of that class
	is not unique


Creating and Accessing Static Members
To create a static variable or method
	static String mSmall;
	static void setMSmall(String desc);
To access a static variable or method
	From another class
		ItemSizes.mSmall;
		ItemSize.setMSmall("Men's Small");
	From withim the class
		mSmall;		
		setSmall("Men's Small);


Method Overloading
	have the same name
	have different signatures
		the number, types, order of parameter
	have different functionality


ACCESS CONTROL
hide fields and methods from other classes
determine how internal data is changed
keep the implementation separate from the public interface
	public interface
		setPrice(Customer cust)
	implementation		
		public void setPrice(Customers cust){
			// set price discount relative to customer
		}
access modifier
	public: accessible by anyone
	private:accessible only within the class

Encapsulation
	hiding object fields
	mandates programming to the interface
	encourages good object-oriented design
   Get and set
 
Declaring 2 dimentional array
	ex. int [] [] yearlySales;
	Syntax:	type [] [] array_identifier;

Instantiating 2 Dimensional array
	ex. yearlySales = new int [5] [4]'
	syntax: array_identifier = new type [number_of_arrays] [lenght];

	Number of parameters

Java scope defines where a certain variable or method is accessible in a program

Class components 
	noun-class name
	verb - behavior or method
	adjective- property or field

Take Test

Static modifier - can be accessed without instantiating the class
		-Is shared by all object of the class
		- Is not unique to an object instance

If someone attempts to change the value of a constant after it has already been assigned a value, the compiler will give an error

Promotion - ex. int to double
		byte to short
Casting - ex. long to int
		double to float

Method use to convert a string to a primitive int type, Interger.parseInt

Benefits of Access Control
	keep the implementation separate from the public interface
	determine how internal data gets changed
	hide fields and methods from other classes


Benefits of encapsulation
	method can change the data type to match the field
	encourages good object-oriented design 
	a class can be changed as long as the interface remains the same

Benefits of checking in setter methos provide
	it ensures the validity of data

this- keyword use to call a overloaded constructor from other constructor

Object Reference - value is copied

Exercise:Concatenate a string of Numbers
Take Test

StringBuilder provides a mutable alternative to String
	-is instantiated using the new keyword
	- has many methods for manipulating its value
	-provides better performance because it is mutable
	-can be created with an initial capacity
	-methods for data manipulation: append, delete, insert, replace
String is still needed
	- it may be safer to use an immutable object	
	-  method in the API may require a string
	- instantiation without new

append- method used to concatenate a String to a StringBuilder object
String[]- object type is returned by the String split method

StringBuilder advantages over String for concatenation(or appending)

Declaring and Instantiate StringBuilder
	StringBuilder mySB = new StringBuilder("Hello");

StringBuilder Append
	StringBuilder mySB = new StringBuilder("Hello");
	mySB.append(" World");



String Replace
	String result = phrase.replace("the", "a");
	System.out.println(result);

String split
	String word: result.split("\\s+")
	System.out.println(word); 

\\s+ -newlines, spaces, tabs

Methods used to test for the equality of String Values
	-equalsIgnoreCase
	-equals
	
Negative return value indicate when calling the compareTo method on a String
	-the String is lexicographically less than the string argument

byte -8
short-16
long-64
int-32

Java API Documentation

Java Platform SE & JDK Version 10 API Specification
	This document is divided into three sections:
	JAVA SE:
		The java platform, standard Edition (Java SE) API's define the core Java platform for general-purpose computing
		These API's are in modules whose name start with java
	JDK
		The JDK APIs are specific to the JDK and will not necessarily be available in all implementations of the Java SE platform.
		These API's are in modules whose names start with jdk
	JavaFX
		defines a set of user-interface controls, graphics, media
		and web packages for developing rich client application 
		These API's are in modules whose names start with javafx
		
	

Creating a LocalDateTime Object

	LocalDateTime myDate = LocalDateTime.now();
	System.out.println(mydate);
	System.out.println(mydate.getDayOftMonth() );
	System.out.println(mydate.getHours() );

Using Calendar
	import java.time.LocalDateTime;
	import java.time.chrono.JapaneseDate;
	import java.time.chrono.ThaiBuddhistDate;


	LocalDateTime myDate = LocalDateTime.now();	
	System.out.println(mydate);

	JapaneseDate jDate = JapaneseDate/from(myDate);
	System.out.println(jDate);

	ThaiBuddhishDate tDate = ThaiBuddhishDate.from(mydate);
	System.out.println(jDate);


	
	
Online Documentation would you find information for classes belonging to the core platform
	Modules beginning with javafx
	Modules beginning with java
	
Method of LocalDateTime can be used to get the current date and time
	now()

java.time.chrono - package contains Java classes that represent alternate calendar system


Valid values from the FormatStyle enumeration
	LONG, SHORT, FULL

parse() - method of the LocalDate class, is able to convert a string into a LocalDate
		instance

Approaches valid way to avoid an infinitte while loop - in the body of the while block, adjust values that effect the expression


enhanced for - type of loop most appropriate for processing elements in Java array




 Nested for loop is the most appropriate for iterating a 2d array

step over - debugger action allow us to skip over a method call when in debug mode

The purpoes of breakpoint when developing a Java app is pause the app when running in debug mode

When paused at a breakpoint in a debugging session for a Java app - it define new breakpoint, modify variable values and inspect the stack trace


Inheritance allows one class to be derived from another
	less code duplication
	edits are done in one directions
	Parent class is known as superclass
	child class is known as subclass


Java Class Hierarchy and Inheritance
Creating Subclasses
Overriding Methods in the Superclass
Using the super keyword
Polymorphism
Casting Superclass References
Using the instanceof Operator
Contrasting Abstract and Non-Abstract Classes
Extending an Abstract Class


Polymorphism 
	means that the same message to two different object can have different results
	in Java , it means the same method is implemented differently by different classes
		This is especially powerful in the context of inheritance
		it relies upon the "is a" relationships

Superclass and subclass relationship
	use inheritance only when it is completely valid or unavoidable
		use the "is a" test to decide whether an inheritance relationship makes sense



 
benefits of Encapsulation
	protects an object from unwanted access by clients
	prevents assigning undesired values for its variable by the client, which can make the state of an object unstable
	allows changing the class implementation without modifying the client interface


Pupose of Java Community Process
	Produces java specification requests
	Develop new Java standards
	Provides early access to specifications


public class ClassName{} - Defines a class and the name must be the same as the filename
public static void main(String args[]){} - defines a class method that is dspecial and is invoked when the class is run by the runtime
import<package> -defines other classes of groups of classes used in your class
package<package_name> - Defines where a class lives relative other classes




StringBuilder class method available
	substring
	append
	insert
	length

Singleton Pattern
	details a class implementation that can be instantiated only once
	


Abstract Method
	Cannot have a method body
	Must be declared in an abstract class
	Is overriden in subclasses

final method cannot be overriden and extended


Rules in creating Interface, for your access modifiers, all the methods in the interface are going to be public


default methods 		
	are declared by using the keyword default
	are fully implemented methods within an interface
	privide useful inheritance mechanics



Anonymous Inner Class
Comparing Classes, Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
Lambda Expressions
Writing Lambda Expressions
	


Lambda Expression Defines
arguments list- int x, int y
arrow token ->
body - x+y

example:
	(int x, int y) -> x +y
	(x, y) -> x+y
	(x,y) -> { System.out.println (x +y) ;}
	(String s) -> s.contains("word")
	s -> s.contains("word")

ContainsAnalyzer.java
public class ContainsAnalyzer implements StringAnalyzer{
public boolean analyze( String target, String searchStr) {
	return target.contains (searchStr);
	}
}

Generics
	Provides flexible type safety to your code
	Move many common errors from runtime to compile time
	Provide cleaner, easier-to-write code
	Reduce the need for casting with collections
	Are used heavily in the Java Collections API

Generics with type inference diamond
	Syntax
		There is no need to repeat types on the right side of the statement
		Angle brackets  indicate that type parameters are mirrored
	Simplifies generics declarations
	Saves Typing



Collections 
	is a single object designed to manage a group of object.			
		Objects in  a collection are called elements
		Primitives are not allowed in a collectoin
	Various collection types implement many common data structures:
		Stack, queue, dynamic array, hash
	The collection API relies heavily on generics for its implementation


Set Interface
A set is an interface that contains only unique elements
A set has no index
Duplicate elements are not allowed
You can iterate through elements to access them. 	
TreeSet provides sorted implementation



Map Interface
A collection that stores multiple key-value pairs
	Key: Unique identifier for each element in a collection
	Value: A value stored in the element associated with the key
Called:"associative arrays" in other languanges


Ordering Collections
Th Comparable and Comparator interfaces are used to sort collections
	Both are implemented using generics
Using the Comparable interface:
	Overrides the compareTo method
	Provides only one sort option
Using the Comparator interface:
	is implemented by using the compare methos
	enables you to create multiple Comparator classes
	enables you to create and use numerous sorting options



Using the Builder Pattern
allows object creation using mthod chaining
	makes code easier to read
	more flexible object creation	
	Object returns itself
	A fluent approach
Java Streams 
	Streams
		java.util.stream
		a sequence of elements on which various methods can be chained
	Method Chaining
		multiple methods can be called in one statement
	Stream Characteristics
		Immutable
		Once elements are consumed, they are no longer available from the stream
		A chain of operations can occur only once on a particular stream (a pipeline)
		Can be serial(default) or parallel

Pipeline defined
	A stream pipeline consist of;
		A source 
		0 Or more intermediate operations
		One terminal operation	
The filter MEthod
	The stream class converts collections to a pipeline
		immutable data
		can only be used once and then tossed
	Filter methos uses predicate lambdas to select items
Syntax;
	System.out.println("\n== CA Transations Lambda ==");
	tList.stream()
		.filter(t -> t.getState().equals("CA"))
		.foreach(SalesTxn: :printSummary); -------> Lambda expression


Method references
	
	alternatively, you can use a method reference
		- foreach(SalesTxn: :printSummary));
	Use of method reference
		Reference to a static method
			- ContainingClass: :staticMethodName
			-Reference to an instance method
			-Reference to ana  instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type(e.g.. String: : compareToIgnoreCase)
			-Reference to a constructor
				- ClassName: :new


Built in Functional Interfaces
	why not just jump to the cool streams stuff?
	Lambda expression rely on functional interfaces
		Important to understand what an interface does
		concept make using lambdas easier
	Focus on the purpose of main functional interfaces
	Become aware of many primitive variations
	Lambda expressions have properties like a variable
		Use when needed
		or can be stored and reused

The java.util.function package
	Predicate: an expression that returns a boolean
	Consumer: An expression that performs operations on an object passed as argument and has a void return type
	Function: Transform a T to a U
	Supplier: Provides an instance of a T (such as a factory)
	Primitive variations
	Binary Variations


Primitve Interfaces
Primitive versions of all main interfaces
	will see these a lot in method calls
Return a primitive
	ex. ToDoubleFunction
Consume a primitive
	ex. DoubleFunctions
Why have these?
	avoid auto-boxing and unboxing



Using Binary Version of Base Interfaces
Using the Unary Operator Functional Interfaces

	
Types of Opertions
	Intermdiate
		-filter() map()	peek()
	Terminal
		foreach() count() sum() average() min() max() collect()
	Termimal short-circuit
		findFirst() findAny()	anyMatch() allMatch() noneMatch()


Extracting Data with Map
map(Function<? super T,? extends R> mapper)
	a map takes one Function as an argument.
		a function take one generic and return something else.
	Primitive versions of map	
		- mapToInt() mapToLong() mapToDouble()


Flatten Data with flatMap
	use the flatMap method to flatten data in a steam.

Taking a Peek
	peek(Consumer<? super T> action)
		The peek method performs the operations specified by the lambda expression and returns the elements to the stream.
		Great for printing intermediate results



Search Methods: Overview
	findFirst()
		returns the first elements that meets the specified criteria
	allMatch()
		returns true if all the elements meet the criteria
	noneMatch()
		returns true of none of the elemets meeet the criteria
	All of the above are short-circuit terminal operations.

Search Methods
	Nondeterministic search methods
		for nondeterministic cases. In effect , situations where parallel are more effective
		Results may vary between invocations
	findAny()
		returns the first element found that meets the specified criteria
		results may vary when performed in parallel
	anyMatch()
		returns true if any elements meet the criteria 
		results may vary when performed in parallel

Optional Class
	Optional<T>
		a container object that may or may not contain a  non-null value
		if a value is present , isPresent() returns true.
		get() returns the value
		Found in java.util.
	Optional Primitives
		OptionalDouble OptionalInt OptionalLong

Lazy Operations
	only do the needful
	- can be optimized
	-only required operations are performed



Steam Data methods
	count()
		returns the count of elements in this stream
	max(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
		Returns the maximum elements of this streams according to the provided Comparator
	min(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
		returns the minimum element of this stream according to the provided Comparator

Performing Calculations
	average()
		returns an optinal describing the arithmetic mean of elements of this stream
		return an empty optional if this stream is empty
		type returned depends on primitive class
	sum()
		returns the sum of elements in this stream
		Methods are found in primitive streams
			DoubleStream, IntStream, LongStream



Sorting
	sorted()
		returns a stream consisting of  the elements sorted according to natural order
	sorted(Comparator<? super T> comparator
		returns a stream consisting of the elements  sorted according to the Comparator


Saving Data from a stream
	collect(Collector<? super T, A, R> collector)
		allows you to save the result of a stream to a new data structure
		relies on the collections class
		ex. 
			stream().collect(Collector.toList());
			stream().collect(Collector.toMap());

Collector class
	averagingDouble(ToDoubleFunction<? super T> mapper)
		produces the arithmetic mean of a double-valued function applied to the inputs elements
	groupingBy(Function<? super T,? extends K> classifier)
		a "group by" operation on input elements of type T, grouping elements according to a classification function, and returning the results in a map
	joining()
		concatenates the input elements into a String, in encounter order
	partitioningBy(Predicate<? super T> predicate)
		partition the input elements according to a predicate

Quick Stream with Stream.of
	stream.of method allows you to easily create a stream


Error Handling
	errors:
		should be the "exception" and not the expected behavior
		must be handled to create reliable applications
		can occur as the result of application bugs
		can occur because of factors beyond the control of a the application
			databases becoming unreachable
			hard drives failing

Exception Handling in Java
	Handling an exception means you must add in a code block to handle the error
	declaring an exception means you declare that a method may fail to execute successfully

Checked exeptions, which must be "handled or declared"
Unchecked exceptions, which are not typically " handled or declared"        



Using try-with-resources statements
	is a try statement that declares one or more resources
	any class that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable can be used as a resources

Custom exceptions
	you can create custom exception classes by extending Exception or one of its subclasses

Assertions

	use assertions to document and verify the assumptions and internal logic of a single method;
		internal invariants
		control flow invariants
		class invariants
	Inappropriate uses of assertions
		do not use assertions to check the parameters of a public method
		do not use method that can cause side effects in the assertion check



Assertion Syntax
	2 forms of assert statement:
		assert booleanExpression;
			this statements test the boolean expression.
			it does nothing if the boolean expression evaluates to true.		
			if the boolean expression evaluates to false, this statement throws an AssertionError.
		assert booleanExpression : expression;
			this form acts just like assert booleanExpression;
			in addition , if the boolean expresssion evaluated to false, the second argument is converted to a string and is used as descriptive text in the AssertionError message.



Controlling Runtime Evaluation of Assertions
	if assertion checking is disabled, the code runs as fast as if the check were never there.
	assertions check are disable by default. Enable assertions with either of the following commands:
	
	java -enablesassertions MyProgram
	java -ea MyProgram
	

	Assertions checking can be controlled on class, packages, and package hierarchy basis

Previous Java Date and Time
	Disadvantages of java.util.Date (Calendar, TimeZone & DateFormat):
		Does not support fluent API approach
		Instances are mutable - not comapatible with lambda
		not thread safe
		weakly typed calendars
		one size fits all


Java Date and Time API: Goals
	The classes and methods should be straighforward
	The API should support a fluent API approach.
	Instances of time/date objects should be immutable.(This is important for lambda operations.)
	Use ISO standards to define date and time.
	Time and Date operations should be thread safe.
	The API should support strong typing, which makes it much easier to develop good code first. (the compiler is your friend)
	toString will always return a human-readable format
	Allow developers to extend the API easily




The java.time API defines two classes for working with local dates and times (without a time zone):
	LocalDate:
		does not include time		
		a year-month-day representation
		toString- ISO 8601 format(YYYY-MM-DD)
	LocalTime:
		does not include date
		stores hours: minutes:seconds.nanoseconds
		toString -(HH:mm:ss.SSSS)

Modeling Time Zones
	ZoneId: is a specific location or offset relative to UTC
	ex. ZoneId nyTZ= ZoneId.of("America/New_York");
	
	ZoneOffset: Extends ZoneId; specifies the actual time difference from UTC
	ex. ZoneOffset USEast = ZoneOffset.of("-5");
	
	ZoneRules: is the class used to determine offsets


Dates and time amounts
Instant - Stores an instant in time on the time-line
	useful for: timestamps, e.g login events
	Store as seconds (long) , and  nanoseconds (int)
	Methods used to compare before and after

Period is a class that holds a date-based amount
	Years, months, and days based on the ISO-8601 calendar
	Plus and minus work with a conceptual day, thus preserving daylight savings changes

Duration is a class that stores a time-based amount.	
	Time is model as actual seconds and nanoseconds
	Days are treated as 24 hours, and ignores daylight savings

              
                  Calculating Between Days
TemporalUnit is an interface representing a unit of time. 
	Implemented by the enum class ChronoUnit
	Period also provides a between method

DateTimeFormatter produces formatted date/times
	Using predefined constant, patterns letters, or a localized style.


LocalDate -class that holds an events such as bdays, anniversary, or meetings
ChronoUnit- holds time units such as half days, hours, years, and weeks
ZoneId- defines as a specific location or offset relative to Coordinated Universal Time or UTC

"MMMM d, yyyy"- US common string date format



Java I/O Basics
	java defines  an I/O channel as a stream
	an I/O stream represents an input source or an output destination
	an I/O stream can represent many different kinds of sources and destination, including disk files, devices, other programs , and memory arrays
	I/O streams support many different kinds of data, including simple bytes , primitive data types, localized characters, and objects

Byte Streams InputStream Methods
	3 Basic read method are:
	int read()
	int read(byte[] buffer)
	int read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int length)

	Other methods include:
	void close();			//close an open stream
	int available();		//Number of bytes available
	long skip(long n);		//Discard n bytes from stream


	
Character Stream
	
	3 basic read method are:
	int read()
	int read(char[] cbuf)
	int read(char[] cbuf, int offset, int length)

	Other methods include:
	void close()
	boolean ready()
	long skip(long n)
	boolean markSupported()
	void mark(int readAheadLimit)
	void reset()

Chaining Stream
	
	Data source | -> File Input Stream -> Buffered Input Stream -> Data Input Stream -> Program

	Program -> Data Output Stream -> Buffered Output Stream -> File Output Stream -> | Data Sink
 

Reading and Writing data from the console

Console I/O
	The System class in the java.lang package has 3 static instance field: out, in, and err.
	The System.out field is a static instance of a PrintStream object that enables you to write to standard output
	The System.in field is a static instance of an InputStream object that enables you to read from standard input.
	The System.err field is a static instance of a PrintStream object that enables you to write to standard error.

Writing to Standard Output
	The println and print method are part of the java.io.PrintStream class.
	The println method print the arguments and a newline character(\n).
	The print method print the argument without a newline character.
	The print and printLn methods are overloaded for most primitive types (boolean, char, int, long, float, and double) and for char[], object, and String.
	The print(object) and println(object) methods call the toString method on the argument


java.io.InputStreamReader; - get the input of the user


Serialization

Persistence
	Saving data to some type of permanent storage is called persistence. An Object that is pesistent-capable can be stored on disk (or any other storage device), or sent to another machine to be store there.
		A non-persisted object exists only as long as the Java Virtual Machine is running
		Java serialization is the standard mechanism for saving an object as a sequence of bytes that can later be rebuilt into a copy of the object.
		To serialize an object of a specific class , the class must implement the java.io.Serialization interface.


Serialization and Object Graphs
	When an object is serialized, only the field of the object are preserved.
	When a field references an object, the fields of the referenced object are also serialized, if that object's class is also serializable.
	The tree of an object's fields constitutes the object graph.

Trancient Fields and Objects
	Some objects classes are not serializable because they represent transient operating System--specific information. 
	If the object graph contains a non-serializable reference,a NotSerializableException is thrown and the serialization operation fails.
	Fields that should not be serialized or that do  not need to be serialized can be marked with the keyword transient.

Serial Version UID
	During serialization, a version number, serialVersionUID, id used to associate the serialized output with the class used in the serialization process.
	After Deserialization, the serialVersionUID is checked to verify that the classes loaded are compatible with the object being deserialized.
	If the receiver of a serialized object has loaded classes for that object with different serialVersionUID, deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException.
	A serializable class can declare its own serialVersionIUD by explicitly declaring a field named serialVersionIUD as a static final and of type long:
		private static long serialVersionUID = 42L;



Conclusion:
	Streams - used to perform Java input and output operations
	void flush(); - OutputStream method that is used to force a write to the stream
	FileReader & FileWriter- classes that are used when using the character format rather than the byte format
	Mark transient - when the object should not or does not need to be serialized.




Limitation of java.io.File
	Does not work well with symbolic links
	Scalability Issues
	Performance Issues
	Very limited set of file attributes
	Very basic file system access functionality

In NIO.2, both files and directories are represented by a path, which is the relative or absolute location of the file or directory.

Relative Path Vs. Absolute Path
	a path is either relative or absolute
	an absolute path always contains the root elements and the complete directory list required to locate the file.
	ex. ...
	    /home/peter/statusReport
	    ...

	A relative path must be combined with another path in order to access a file.
	ex. ...
	    clarence/foo
	    ...

Java NIO.2 Concepts
Prior to JDK 7, the java.io.File class was the entry point for all file and directory operations. With NIO.2, there is a new package and classes:
	java.noi.file.Path: Locates a file or a directory by using a system-dependent path
	java.io.file.Files: Using a Path, performs operations on files and directories
	java.nio.file.FileSystem: Provides an interfaces to a file system and a factory for creating a Path and other object that accesss a file system.
	All the methods that access the file system throw IOException or a subclass.

Path Interface
	The java.io.file.Path interface provides the entry point for the NIO.2 file and directory manipulation.
	
	ex. FileSystem fs = FileSystems.getDefault();
	Path p1 = fs.getPath("/home/oracle/labs/resources/myFile.txt");
	
	To Obtain a Path object , obtain an instance of the default file system. and then invoke the getPath method:
	
	ex. 
	Path p1 = Path.get("/home/oracle/labs/resources/myFile.txt");
	Path p2 = Path.get("/home/oracle", "labs", "resources", "myFile.txt");

Path Interface Features
	The path interface defines the methods used to locate a file or a directory om a file system. These methods include:
		To access the components of a path:
			- getFileName, getParent, getRoot, getNameCount
		To operate on a path:
			-normalize, toUri, toAbolutePath, subpath, resolve, relativize
		To compare path:
			-startsWith, endsWithm equals


Removing Redundancies from a Path
	Many files system use "." notation to denote the current directory and ".." to denote the parent directory.
	ex. /home/./clarence/foo
		/home/peter../clarence/foo
	
	The normalize method removes any redundant elements, which includes any "." or "directory/.." occurrences
	ex.
		Path p = Path.get("/home/peter/../clarence/foo");
		Path normalizedPath = p.normalize();
	
		/home/clarence/foo

Creating a Subpath
	A portion of a path can be obtained by creating a subpath using the subpath method:
	
	Path subpath(int beginIndex, int endIndex);
	
	The element returned by endIndex is one less that the endIndex value.
	ex.
	Path p1 = Path.get ("/home/oracle/Temp/foo/bar");
	Path p2 = p1.subpath (1,3);
	oracle/Temp


Joining 2 Paths
	The resolve method is used to combine 2 paths
	ex. 
	Path p1 = Path.get ("/home/clarence/foo/");
	p1.resolve("bar"); // Returns /home/oracle/Temp/foo/bar
	
	Passing an absolute path to the resolve method returns the passing-in path
	ex. Path.get("foo").resolve("/home/clarence"); // Returns /home/clarence


Checking a file or Directory
	a Path object represents the concept of a file or a directory location. Before  you can access a file or directory, you should first access the file system to detemine whether it exist using the following Files methods:
		exists(Path p, LinkOption... option)
		Test to see wheter a file exist. By default, symbolic links are followed.
		notExist(Path p, LinkOption... option)
		Test to see wheter a file does not exist. By default, symbolic links are followed.



To verify that a file can be accessed , the Files class provides the following boolean methods.
	isReadable (Path)
	isWritable(Path)
	isExecutable(Path)



Creating Files and Directories
	Files and directorues can be created using of the following methods:
		Files.createFile (Path dir);
		Files.createDirectory (Path dir);
	The createDirectories method can be used to create directories that do not exist, from top to bottom:
	Files.createDirectories(Paths.get("/home/oracle/Temp/foo/bar/example"));

Deleting a File or Directory
	You can delete files, directories, or links. The Files class provides 2 methods:
	 	delete(Path)
		deleteIfExist(Path)
	//...
	Files.delete(path);
	//...


Copying a File or Directory
	using the copy(Path,Path, CopyOption...) method

Moving  a File or Directory
	using the move(Path,Path, CopyOption...) method
  

Walk the Directory Structure
	The Files.walk() method walk the Directory Structure


BufferedReader File Stream
	The new lines() method converts a BufferedReader into  a stream.
	The lines() method can be called using NIO classes
	Use readAllLines() to load a file into an ArrayList


Conclusion:


Concurrency & Parallelism

absulute - type of path always contains the root element and the complete directory list that is required to locate the file
lines() -new method converts a BufferedReader into a stream


Legacy Thread and Runnable
	Extends the Thread Class
		simpler code
	Implements the Runnable interface
		- More flexible
		- extends is still free

java.util.concurrent package- contains classes that are useful in concurrent programming


java.util.concurrent.Callable
- callable interface
	similar to Runnable, but can: 	
		return a result using generics
		throw a checked exception

Threading Concerns
	Thread Safety
		Classes should continue to behave correctly when accessed from multiple threads
	Performance: Deadlock and livelock
		Threads typically interact with other threads. As more threads are introduced into an application, the possibility exist threads will reach a point where they cannot continue


Atomic Operation
	functions as a single operation


Deadlock results when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.

java.util.concurrent.atomic package
	lock free thread-safe variables
CyclicBarrier
	a class that blocks until a specified number of threads are waiting for the thread to complete
Concurrency collections


Without Parallelism
	modern system contain multiple CPUs. If you do not leverage threads in some way, only a portion of your system's processing power will be utilized

Naive parallelism
	a simple parallelism solution breaks the data to be processed into multiple sets. One data set for each CPU and one thread to process each data set.

         

Fork-Join Framework

	splitting datasets into equal sized subset for each thread to process has a couple of problems. Ideally all CPUs should be fully utilized until the task is finished but:
		CPUs may run a  different speeds
	

Work-Stealing
	divide the data to be processed into a large number of subsets
	Assign the data subset to a thread's processing queue
	Each thread will have many subsets

ForkJoinPool is used to execute a ForkJoinTask. It creates a thread for each CPU in the system by default.


Fork-Join framework Recommendations
	Avoid I/O or blocking operations
	Know your hardware
	Know your Problem


Reduction - an operation that takes a sequence of input elements and combines them into a single summary result by repeated application of a combining operation
		- implemented with the reduce() method


Performance
	Do not assume parallel is always faster
	Qualitative Considerations
	Primitive Streams provided for performance



The JDBC API & Localization


Properties
java.util.Properties class is used to load and save key-value pairs in Java
can be stored in a simple text file
File name ends in .properties
File can be anywhere that compiler can find it.	

Resource Bundle
ResourceBundle class isolates locale-specific data:
	Returns key/value pair stored separately
	Can be a class or a .properties file
Step to use:
	Create bundle files for each locale
	Call a specific locale from your application

Format Date and Currency
java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter
java.text.NumberFormat
Create object using Locale.

Displaying Currency
Format Currency:
	Get a currency instance from NumberFormat
	Pass the Double to the format method


Displaying Dates
Format a dates
	get a DateTimeFormatter object based on the Locale.
	From the LocaleDateTime variable, call the format method passing the formatter

JUnit Fundamentals


When doing regression testing we want to be able to manage test in small groups. What class is defined in JUnit to allows us to do this?
	---@SuiteClasses


The @After annotation provides us a way to help clean up our testing environment. The @After annotation signals JUnit to run the methods at which point in the testing cycle?
	--After each test has been run

There are times when we want to put control to the results in the hands of the test designer and developer, which may or may not be the same person that's developing the code. What annotation in JUnit allows us to be able to specify what will be returned by the called method regardless of how that method actually behaves?
	---@Mock

In JUnit there is a really powerful way to allow us me to focus in, to just run a specific type of test. We can define at a method level much more than at class level, which types of test I want to run. Which annotation allows us to unlock this functionality?
	---@Category


JUnit provides a basic test runner that will execute most test cases for you. As we expand the custom features that needs special test condition or use third party solutions, we need to use the smarter test runner to execute our test. What must be passed as a parameter into the @RunWith cutom runner annotation in order for test cases to execute correctly?	
	--A class object



While the test fixture capability provides many good options Managing files, database connection, pr any customized solution you wish to create, in a reusable way can be accomplished by which of the following annotations?
	--@Rule

Test cases are written to check functionality, but the test space can often be expanded dramatically by simply changing the input values to a test. JUnit provides a mechanism, by which we can execute a test many times across a changing set of inputs. What is the annotation that allows us to use this functionality?
	--@Parameters

When doing performance testing or testing to see how the system responds to a lot of data, JUnit provides us with a tool to simplify the process. This tool allows us to perform rapud test data generation and clear mechanism for externalizing data. It even gives us the ability to check that the data is valid and this reducing false failures. What is the feature within JUnit that allows us to do so?
	--Theories


Test suites have always existed in JUnit, but have changed quite a bit from the legacy to the current approach. If you deal with legacy test suites, it may be useful to see how they can be used or converted into their modern equivalent. Legacy JUnit testing required you to do what to the TestSuitee class in order to be able to use it?
	--extend

In JUnit there is an annotation that provides us an extension to give us universal checks across all test cases within a JUnit test, or further details and control within each test. It gives us moere granularity and control to create customized testing, beyond what is provided in basic JUnit. What is that annotation?
	--@Rule


JUnit has been a solid testing framework for a very long time. The most recent versions take a great advantage of annotations. But many test were created before this job enchancement. Legacy test cases had extended out what class?
	--TestCase

JUnit is most effective when run with every change, to ensure that the code is always working. Integrating JUnit into tools, which executes many Java builds these days, allows us to test the code each time it is recompiled. What is a tool that can be integrated with JUnit to do this?
	--Maven

While we wan out test to always be passing, it's inevitable that some will fail ovet time. As features are not yet developed, are being changed, or simply we just don't have time to fix the test. While we still may want that test around, we now have the ability to temporarily ignore it's execution using a simple annotation. Which of the following annotation allows for this functionality?
	--@Ignore


Most testing is directed at funtional requirements and satisfying the behavior within the system. We cannot forget, however, that execution time is a factor for the acceptability of solution as well. Which of the following is a properly formatted annotation that will have a time limit of 2 seconds before the test is considered to have failed?
	--@Test(timeout=2000)


By default JUnit will execute test cases in whatever order it decides, which could vary each time the test is executed. Some test designs must assume a specific orfer for each test case. What annotation in JUnit allow us to be able to specify the order that tests will run?
	--@FixMethodOrder

sudo chage -l <username> = it will tell everything about their password

sudo useradd -D = it will show all the defaults

cd /etc/skel = skeleton folder


sudo less /etc/login.defs = login definition


GROUP creating
ex. sudo groupadd Sales
    tail  etc/group


Group deletion
	groupdel or group delete

Changing the name
sudo groupmod -n <new name> <old name>


Add user into the group
sudo gpasswd -a <username> <group name> = group password command and also allow you to add user to the group

Remove the user from the group
sudo gpasswd -d <username> <group name>

Make the user the administrator to the group
sudo gpasswd -A <username> <group name>

CHANGE THE GROUP CONTENT FOR A MOMENT
newgrp <group name> = change the context for a moment

chown = to change the owner

getent or get entity = used to find information inside of the /etc/group/ and /etc/passwd file as well

CONCLUSION:

passwd = command can an administrator use to change the password of an existing user account

The advantage of using the -r switch in the context of the userdel command is it removes user's home directory

Currently the most common use of the -c switch of the useradd command is to store user's fullname

cat etc/group |grep <username> = command that would reveal the MOST information about groups of a certain username.

The effects of using the -A switch when executing the gpasswd command are add a user to a group and then makes the defined user a group administrator


CompTIA Linux+: File Access & Permissions
Working with File Permission and Ownership

ls -l = command for longer list of names



	
	Owner 
	permissions
	   |
	   |	Other permissions
	   |       |
	d rwx r-x r-x DirA
	|      |	  
    Type     Group
    of 	     permission
    Objects


rwx= means read, write, execute

Identities
u            = user
g	     = group
o	     = other

Permissions
- 		=none
r		=read
w		=write
x		=execute  

Numerical Values
4		= Read
2		= write
1		= execute

Numerical Notation
0	=none
1	=execute
2	=write
3	=Write and execute
4	=read
5	=read and execute
6	=read and write
7	=read, write and execute


Modify Permissions

man chmod
ex.
chmod g+w <file>
chmod o-r <file>
chmod g+w, o-r <file>
chmod u=rw, g=rw, o-rwx <file>   // Equal symbol override the permission

File listing
ls -l file* = files details


umask = what defines the default permission

umask Values

0 =read, write and execute
1 =read and write
2 = read and execute
3 =read only
4 = write and execute
5 =write only
6 =execute only
7 = no permissions

mkdir <directory name> = make directories

chown <specify the owner you want to be> 
sudo chown <name of owner>:<group> <file> = change the owner


Change the group
chgrp <group> <file>

Change the group without changing the owner
sudo chown :<group> <file>


Change the ownership in sub-directories
sudo chown -R <name> /home/<filename>/*

When you take the archieve, if you use the tar command to wrap up the files first, the tar
command will actually back up the permission as well.

What FACLs do, is they allows us to assign extra stuff, you still have the UGO that doesn't change

getfacl
setfacl = modify new style FACL permission and also the old style Unix.
-m = means modify
ex. setfacl -m o::r <file> 
    setfacl -m u:<username>:rw <file>
    setfacl -m g:<group name>:rw <file>


-t = Sticky bit is designed for shared folders, it tells the folder to watch for when people create documents to be able to tack that on and keep track of who created it

Turn on the sticky bit using the chmod
ex. chmod o+t,g+t CorpData

CONCLUSION:

setfacl and getfacl commands enables for Linux administrator to access to more advance and granular permissions

chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r file2.txt & chmod u+x,o-w file2.txt =commands that grant owners read, write and execute; group memeber read and write; and other read only permission on afile named file2.txt that already had the permission -rw-rw-rw

An administrator types ls -l they recieve the results d rwx r-x r-wx DirA. What does the "r-x" represent in this output?
	group permissions


What is the purpose of the sticky bit in Linux permission?
	ensure that only file creators can delete their files

Virtualization Concepts

CompTIA A+ 220-1001: Virtualization

Overview  Virtualization
-Resource Utilization
-Software abstraction
-Behaves like hardware
-Redefines elements of IT



- Multiple installations of an operating systen on a single physical computer
	-Not simulated

-Isolated enabled by protocols and APIs
	-Greater flexibility
	-Reduced costs
	-Increased value

- Memory Requirements
	-Multiple operating system
	-Large memory requirements


Key benefits
-Flexibility
-Cost
-Scalability
-Reliability
-Performance


Purpose of Virtual Machines
-Perform tasks like a separate computer
-Guest VMs are created within the host
-A host can service multiple guest VMs
-Limited only by the physical resources available
	-On the physical host itself
	-How much has been allocated to each virtual machines

Common Uses 
- Trying new operating systems
- Testing new software
- Disaster recovery
- System Backup
- Business continuity
- Legacy systems
- Physical-to-virtual conversion 


Determining Virtual Machine Resource Requirements
-Study vendor published requirements
-Ensure appropriate amount of memory for application
-Providing excess memory resources
	-May improve VM performance
	- In certain cases, operating system will not recognize excess memory
	-Ineffective use of resources


Considerations for Using the performance Monitor
-Used traditionally inside a VM
-Work well for memory usage
-Not ideal for tracking CPU and I/O usage
-Can help with VM capacity planning
-Does not capture resources available to the whole(host) system
-Measurements can be skewed


Overview of Emulators
-Guest system do not have direct access to the actual hardware of the host system
-Guest systems use virtual devices for their configuration
-Emulator are used to present what appears to be an actual device to the guest system
-Emulator translate requests from the guest system to the host system

Common Emulated Devices
-Legacy Network adapters
-Floppy disk drives
-IDE/SCSI hard drives
-CD/DVD drives

Emulator Requirements
-Dependent on the host system
	-Host operating system and/or version
	-Hypervisor
-Virtual Machines are generally unaware that they are running as virtual machines, but newer host computer are aware of the virtual machine they are hosting
	-Newer Operating system and hypervisor require fewer emulators
		-Microsoft Hyper-V
			-Generation 1 vs Generation 2
			-Generation 2 supports VMBus which reduces the use of emulators





Security of Virtualization
-Evaluate risks
-Implements Measures
-Monitor
-Manage

Virtualization Security Measures
-Granular Security controls
-Granular security procedures
-Granular control and authority
-Protecting against vulnerabilities of physical system
-Setting security policies



Meeting Network Requirements
-Physical Computer hosting multiple virtual machine can have much higher network demands
	-Bandwith optimization
	-Multiple network adapters 
	- Compression or encrytion offloading	
	-Traffic prioritization techniques

Network Challenges with VDI
-Virtual desktop infrastructure is taxing to network
-Types of networks
	-Local area networks
	-Wide area networks
	-Internet
-Delayed performance/lag
	-Particularly for real-time applications
-Test and verify you network performance thoroughly before deploying a VDI configuration



Hypervisor
-Central to the concept of virtualization
-Separates OS and application from physical hardware
-Enables a physical host machine to operate numerous guest machines
-Capabilities extend to personal computers as well as servers

Key benefits
-Logical separation
-Isolation
-Easier to move and migrate

Types of Hypervisor
Type 1 Hypervisor
		Hardware
		   |
		Hypervisor
		   |
		___|___
		|     |
	    Guest 1  Guest 2


Type 2 
		Hardware
		   |
		Host OS
		   |
		Hypervisor
		   |
		___|___
		|     |
	    Guest 1  Guest 2


Security Concerns
-Malware
-Rootkits



CONCLUSION:

 If you have a virtual machine running a 32-bit version of an operating system and it currently has 4 GB of RAM configured, what level of performance boost should you expect if you allocate an additional 4 GB?
	None


 What functionality is provided by emulators in virtualization?
	They intercept hardware requests from the virtual machine and pass them to the physical machine



Which virtual machine resource setting often cannot be changed while the virtual machine is running?
	Memory


Which type of computing configuration can result in a much higher demand on your local area network when using virtualization?
	Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)



Why should the security of a physical host machine be given additional consideration?
	Because corruption of the host can result in corruption of all virtual machines on that host


Which type of computing scenario most closely describes virtualization?
	A single physical computer hosting multiple logical computers


Which feature of hypervisors distinguishes type 1 from type 2?
	Type 2 has a local operating system installed on the host system

Unintelligible commands
	Java has its own syntax
Compiler error
	-will be detexted immediately
Runtime error
	-not detected until program running

Common Syntax Errors in Java
	Forgetting to import a class
	Missing parenthesis
	Splitting a string over two lines
	Treading s static method as an instance method
	Using incorrect capitalization
	Forgetting the class or object
	Missing curly braces

	Not enough memory

Exception Hierarchy
Checked Exceptions
	Typically plan ahead
	Handled-or-declared when writing code
	Detectable before runtime

Unchecked Exceptions
	Also called Runtime Exceptions	
	Occur due to human error
	Checked at runtime
	Often can be countered

Errors
	Most serious exceptional condition
	Often irrecoverable
	Occur due to human and environment errors



Best practices for java Exceptions
	Clean up resources
	Prefer specific exceptions
	Document Exceptions
	Throw exception with descriptive message
	Catch the most specific exception first
	Don't catch throwable
	Don't ignore exceptions
	Don't log and throw
	Wrap the exception

	Checked Exceptions
		IOException
			Input/Output operation fails
		I/O Operations

Java Try Catch Blocks

Java Exceptions
Java try and catch
Finally statement

	Followed by catch
	catch(....){.....}

Java Catch Block
ExceptionType
	Exception handler
		Indicated by its argument
	Executed if and when the exception handler is invoked
		Runtime system

Triggered within the corresponding try block
	Try block "jumps" to catch statement
		Checks for matching exception type
	Error recovery
	Propmt users to make decisions
	Propagate errors

Java Exception Handler
Catch block can handle more than one type of exception
	In Java SE 7 and up
	Reduces code duplication
	Lessens temptation
	Catch parameter is implicitly final

Java Finally Block
	Resource clean-up
	Check for open file., network, and database connections
	Must handle both success and failure conditions

Automated Software Testing


Regression Testing
	used to ensure that any changes that have been made to software haven't broken the software
	
Unit testing 
	a form of white box testing
	isolates and test one portion(unit) of the software



Functional Testing
	A form of black box testing
	Does the software do what it should?
	Does the software meet design requirements?

Fuzzing
	 form of black box testing
	analysis performed on executed code
	fuzzing uses unexpected randomized inputs to determine how software will respond

Black box testing mean that testers don't have access to the source code or implementation details
White box testing mean that testers have access to the source code or implementation details


Steps for implementing Fuzzing
-Identify the target software/system
-Identify software inputs
-Generate fuzz data
-Execute our test using our fuzzing software
-Observe the behavior 
- Review the fuzzer log as well as the application software logs


Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
	can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud depending on where traffic that destined for the web application is routed
