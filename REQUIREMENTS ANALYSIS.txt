
WHAT WE NEED IN REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS;

1. Identify stakeholders: Identify all stakeholders who are involved in the project and understand their needs and                           expectations.

2. Define goals and objectives: Clearly define the goals and objectives of the software system or product.

3. Gather and document requirements: Gather all requirements from the stakeholders, and document them clearly and                                      precisely. Use techniques like interviews, surveys, and brainstorming sessions                                      to gather requirements.

4. Prioritize requirements: Prioritize requirements based on their importance and urgency.

5. Identify constraints: Identify any constraints that could impact the project, such as budget, time, or                          technological constraints.

6. Define use cases: Define the use cases or scenarios that the software system or product should support.

7. Verify and validate requirements: Verify and validate requirements to ensure that they are complete, consistent,                                      and accurate.

8. Create a requirements traceability matrix: Create a requirements traceability matrix to track the progress of                                               each requirement through the development process.

9. Review and get approval: Review the requirements with stakeholders and get their approval before moving to the         	                   next stage of development.


In addition to the requirements document, other outputs of requirements analysis may include:

1. Use cases or scenarios that describe how the software product or system will be used
2. User stories that describe the needs and expectations of end-users
3. Diagrams, such as flowcharts or entity-relationship diagrams, that help to illustrate the requirements
4. Requirements traceability matrix that links each requirement to specific design, development, and testing    activities.
