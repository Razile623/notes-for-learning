JavaScript: Introduction


The Role in JavaScript in Web Applications

Web Browsers - Know how to display the resources in way that is understood by humans
Web Servers - Know how to retrieve the right resources and "serve" them to anyone who ask for it


HTML
- Skeleton of your web pages
- It specifies the content and structure of what your web page will finally look like
- for this skeleton to look human we need more than that
- we need skin over the structure

CSS
- This is the skin of the web page
- It specifies the look and fell of a web page

JavaScript
- The brains behind the web pages
- programming language, which runs inside your browser, that lets you control the behavior of the web page
- its a full-blown language, as sophisticated as C++, Java, or Python
- In Includes objects, inheritance, complex function construct, and a whole lot more
- It is just-in-time compiled and executed by the browser
- it used to be considered a client-side technology, but it is now very common to have JS run on the server side
- it can control the apperance, communications, interaction, etc.

TIP: JavaScript client apps should be kept simple Complex operations should be done on the server


The Document Object Model (DOM)

HTML page Structure
	- All HTML pages have a nice hierarchical structure
	- A browser will parse this HTML hierarchy into a tree



					HTML
				  
				HEAD		BODY
					H1		P


JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM



Fundamental of JavaScript

	JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language, so it has all the usual features you may expect
	
JavaScript Features
	Variables
	Functions
	Loops
	Arrays
	Objects
	Input/Ouput

Functions and Variables
	Creation - functions and variables are created when the page is loaded
	Destruction - They are destroyes when a new page is loaded in the browser
	Scope - Will become a complicated topic in JS, but to start with, it is simple.

		Global variables
			- exist for as long as the page 
			- they come into existence when the page loads, and cease to exist when the page unloads
		Local variables
			- local variable exist inside a function, block, or some specific scope


Variables in JS
	- JS allows variables to be used without being declared first
	- Undeclared variables end up having a global scope
	- To enable re-use of variable names in local scopes, they should be declared first
	- The keyword var, let, and const define the scope and behavior of variables

Scope in JS is fascinating, and very different form other language such as C++, Java, etc.
This becomes quite apparent when implementing closures

JS properties
	-weakly and dynamically typed
	-it may seem very permissive when compared to Java, C++, etc.
	- There are many implicit type conversions that may  lead to unpredictable results
	-Enabling "strict" mode alleviates some of these concerns

Strict Mode
	-prevent the  use of undeclared variables
	-it does not permit the use of reserved keyword as variable or functions names
	-it prevent coding practices that get in the way of optimization performed by JavaScript engines 
	-it throws errors instead of failing silently when unsafe operations are performed
Enabling "strict" mode is considered more secure when developing apps with JS




JavaScript Arrays and Functions

Arrays
	-variables containing a sequence of values
	- content can be heterogeneous
	-their length are dynamic 
	-they can be used to create shallow and deep copies

Array Copies
	Shallow copies
		are effectively different variables pointing to the same underlying data
		changing one copy affects all realted shallow copies
		There are multiple ways to create them in JS
	
	Deep copies
		the copies are entirely independent from each other from the point of creation 
		modifying one copy has no bearing on the others
		created using the slice() method


Functions
	treated just like numbers or strings 
	functions are first-class members
	
3 Properties of JS Functions
	You can have functions take in functions as can arguments
	You can have a function return a functions
	You can store a functions in a variable(or array)

First class functions
	these 3 properties collectively make JS functions "first-class"

A Higher Order Functions
	Operates on other functions -either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
	Their use is JS is very common



JavaScript Objects
	- a set of key-values pairs, where the values  can also be functions
	- each key-value pair is called a property of the object
	- they are similar to maps, dictionaries, and associative arrays
	-The values can be function or even other objects
	- objects can inherit from and be created out of other objects
	
JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

Copying Objects
	objects, like arrays, can have deeo and shallow copies
	when passed as arguments to functions, it is the object reference that is passed
	this contrasts object from primitive types
Passing by values and reference
	function arguments that are primitive types(string, int) are copies of the original data
	arguments that are object are pointer to the same objects


Object Constructors
	a blueprint of a JS object can be defined using a function constructor (similar to classes)
	New instances can be created from these blueprints using the new keyword

Classes of JavaScript
	- it is possible to declare classes in JS, but they are merely syntactic sugar over function constructors
	- Inheritance can be implemented using the extends keyword
	- Under the hood, protoype-based inheritance is used (more on that later)



JavaScript Quirks
	Strange special values	
		the values undefined represents a variable that has been declared but not set to any values
		the value null is explicitly assigned to a variable
		Nan is often returned when math functions fails
		Infinity is an acceptable value in JS
	String and numeric operations
		JS performs implicit conversion of numbers to string for some operations
		Addition and comparisons of numbers with strings may produce unexpected results
	Strange equality operators	
		== is the equality operator and checks for equal values (and perform conversion if needed)
		=== is the strict equality operator - it checks for equal values and types
		== pair with !=
		=== pairs with !==
		Type conversion are never done when comparing objects
		Both equality operator work the same for objects
	Truthy and falsey
		Anything that Javascript can convert to a boolean true in considered truthy
		Non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, non-empty arrays,etc are truthy 
		Anything JavaScript can convert to a boolean false is falsey
		0, "",  undefined,null, {}, and [] are all falsey






JavaScript Closures
	a closure is a package of a function along with its enclosing environment
	
	are important concept in JS
	they offer ways to get many comflex things done(e.g access modifiers)	
	JS framework such as JQuery and Node.js are built on top of closures
	
Closure variable - access inside the closure

Closure variable supersede those in any outer (or global) scopes




Prototype in JavaScript
Object- is a set of key-value pairs, where the values can also be functions
